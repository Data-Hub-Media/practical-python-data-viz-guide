# Overview

This repository contains all materials related to a lecture / seminar I teach on practical data visualization with python. What I mean by "practical" is that the materials herein do not focus on one particularly library or data visualization method; rather, my goal is to empower the consumer of this content with the tools, heuristics, and methods needed to handle a wide variety of data visualization problems. 

This is a work in progress that will be evolving rapidly over the coming weeks and months, so please check back often for new additions and refinements, and if you'd like to contact me, don't hesitate to reach out [via Twitter here](https://twitter.com/ByPaulJ).
